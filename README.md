# SNBTD

This is our implementation for the paper [_Streaming Nonlinear Bayesian Tensor Decomposition_](http://www.auai.org/uai2020/proceedings/210_main_paper.pdf).

# Data Set and Models

All data sets ( including train/test split) we used in the paper reside in the ./data folder, which could be loaded using functions in data_loader.py. 

We provide code for our proposed algorithm, SNBTD, along with two other baseline methods SSGP-NTD and SVB-NTD. For code for POST see https://github.com/yishuaidu/POST.

# System Requirements

All code were tested under python 3.6 and tensorflow 1.14.0.
